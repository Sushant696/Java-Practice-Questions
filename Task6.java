// **6. Design and implement a Java program that simulates the undo feature of a text editor using a stack. The program should support adding text to the editor and undoing changes. The stack should store strings, each representing a version of the text. Implement methods for:**

// - adding text to the editor: addText(String text)
// - undoing changes: undo()
// - getting the current text: getCurrentText()
