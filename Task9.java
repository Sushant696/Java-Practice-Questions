// **9. Write a program that prompts the user to enter five integer values and reads them into an array. The program should consist of the following methods:**

// - A method named “max” that reads an array of integer values and returns the maximum value
// - A method named “indexOfHighest” that returns the index of the highest element in an array of integers. If more than one such element exists, return the smallest index. Invoke the above methods and demonstrate them in the program.
